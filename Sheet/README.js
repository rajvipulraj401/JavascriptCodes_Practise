# Note __

## For Harder problems :--

1) when you are asked the dsa question in the interview you should not tell the optimized solution immediately.

 You should drive the interview , ask about test cases and once you 
have understood the question then you should 

a) first give the brute force solution .( The normal solution that comes to your brain when you see the question instantly)

b) Then you go ahead and optimized and give the better solution and 
then 

c) give the optimal code at last .
